4. **Discord Whitelist Management:**
    * Allow users to join the server and do a verification process.
        - The join the server and have to enter a command (e.g., `/whitelist verify <username>`).
    * This command would check if the username exists on the discord server and have a specific role.
    * Changes made via Discord (like change role/ban users) would sync with the in-game whitelist dynamicly and in real-time.

6. **Whitelist Full Notification & Reason:**
    * When the server is full and a whitelisted player tries to join the server, they receive a notification that the server is full.
    * When a non-whitelisted player tries to join (and a feature like tokens, discord or application is not used), they receive a message indicating that they are not whitelisted and the join is blocked.
    * If one of the features is used, they can join but are freezed and receive a message indicating that they need use one of these activated features.
