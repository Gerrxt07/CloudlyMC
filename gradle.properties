# Java is provided by actions/setup-java in CI and by Gradle toolchains locally (see build.gradle.kts)
# Do NOT hardcode org.gradle.java.home here, it breaks cross-platform builds.
# If you need a local override, set it in your user gradle.properties (~/.gradle/gradle.properties).

# Optionally allow Gradle to auto-download matching JDKs for toolchains
org.gradle.java.installations.auto-download=true

# Optimization settings
org.gradle.caching=true
org.gradle.parallel=true
org.gradle.configureondemand=true
